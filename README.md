# React Testing Workshop

## Tasks

The application spec is helpfully provided by [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md#functionality).

### Part 1: Staying out of React

  1. Flesh out some test scenarios for clearCompleted in `todos-spec.js`.
  2. Implement clearCompleted in `todos.js`.
  3. Move the `.trim()` logic out of `Header.js` and `TodoItem.js` into the data layer in `todos.js` and expand test coverage in `todos-spec.js`.

### Part 2: Shallow Rendering


### Part 3: Visual Feedback
